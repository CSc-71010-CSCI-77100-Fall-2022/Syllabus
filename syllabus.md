## Course Description

This research course aims to expose students to seminal topics and recent trends in the field of Programming Languages and Software Engineering with a focus on program analysis and software maintenance and evolution. The theme topic of the course varies with each offering. For Fall 2022, the theme of the course will be programming language concepts and software engineering for Machine Learning (ML), including Deep Learning (DL), systems. Such systems have become pervasive in society recently, and their programming and engineering come with unique challenges. Our focus in this course will be to improve nonfunctional aspects of these systems. Nonfunctional aspects of software may include security, run-time performance,[^1] and modularity. DL systems, mainly, work with a lot of data; thus, performance---especially in the training stage---is of the utmost importance. However, programming and engineering such systems are complex, especially for data scientists, who may not be classically trained Software Engineersâ€”as such, having both programmability and performance of DL systems is our goal. Doing so would avert potential errors, misclassifications, faulty predictions, and performance bottlenecks, which otherwise cost time, energy, and money.

We will be investigating:

1. Innovative future automated development techniques (program analysis, software engineering, and human-computer interaction) of ML/DL software systems, and
1. The technical research thrusts that enable new ways to program and engineer ML/DL systems.

The course will allow students to pursue research-oriented or novel industrial term projects individually or in small teams (2-3 students). Our exploration will consist of in-class discussions of the literature and team projects that encourage risk-taking. Students may choose projects from a list of project ideas provided by the instructor. Alternatively, students may pitch a project to the instructor or class. Projects should involve programming languages and software engineering. Projects exploring the intersection of programming languages, software engineering, software maintenance and evolution, and ML/DL systems are welcome and encouraged.

To complement the innovative facets of the course, we will couple the investigations with a firm theoretical foundation in programming languages, program analysis and transformation, integrated development environment engineering, and software maintenance and evolution. Other topics may include control-flow analysis, dataflow analysis, SSA form, type analysis, pointer/alias analysis, side-effect analysis, and program slicing. Imperative and Object-Oriented programming paradigms---and their application in dynamic languages (like Python)---will be thoroughly considered.

The course materials will include an introduction to basic foundations and current advances in the area of, for example, static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) program analysis, as well as some related program transformations. Static program analyses are traditionally used in compilers and interpreters for performance optimizations and in software engineering tools for understanding, evolution, debugging, and testing. The material will be helpful for students working in compilers, systems, software engineering, and programming languages, or incorporating such areas into their ongoing research in other areas (interdisciplinary research).

## Course Objectives

- Expand students' knowledge more broadly about Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Software Maintenance and Evolution research & practice, and become familiar with the state-of-the-art research under the theme of ML/DL System programming and engineering.
- Develop critical thinking abilities by being able to assess the quality of published research and pose new research questions.
- Practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others.
- Engage in active learning activities in class, such as research discussions.
- Practice developing a research or novel-industrial project through all its stages: formulating a research problem, posing research questions, gathering related work, designing a solution, evaluating the solution empirically, and writing a research paper.
- Have fun learning.

## Course Organization

The course will have the following parts:

### Lectures by the Instructor

The goal of these lectures is to establish some background for the project. I will present an overview of some basic programming languages and software engineering concepts, including **static analyses** and the related **program transformations**. No previous knowledge of program analysis is expected. I will start from scratch and cover several specific analyses/transformations and the corresponding theoretical foundations.

### Presentations by Students

Students will prepare and deliver presentations on selected topics. By doing so, students will practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others.

### Homework

- There will be one or more homework assignments with small problems related to the material presented in the lectures. Each will be assigned in Blackboard along with submission instructions. The exact instructions will follow.
- Students should do assignments independently. General, high-level discussion of assignments with other students in the class is allowed, but all actual work should be your own. Written assignments that show excessive similarities will be taken as evidence of cheating and dealt with accordingly. See more details below under "Academic integrity."
- Assignments should be turned in by the beginning of the lecture on the due day. You can submit it 24 hours after the deadline; if you do so, your score will be reduced by 10%. The submission will not be accepted if you submit more than 24 hours after the deadline.

### Project

Students may implement the project individually or with small teams (2-3 students). Projects should be specific to each student/student team and tailored to their ongoing and future research.

## Textbooks and Materials

Selected research papers will be available online.

## Prerequisites

You should have basic knowledge of an imperative, Object-Oriented programming language, such as Java, C++, or Python. Furthermore, it would help if you had some experience developing medium to large software systems to appreciate the engineering challenges appropriately involved. Speak with me if you are not sure whether you have the necessary background.

## Attendance

This is an interactive course. Attendance is expected for each class meeting. Excused absences include University-related travel (e.g., to attend an academic conference), job interviews, and illness; please notify me beforehand or as soon as possible.

## Mode of Delivery

This course is in-person in Graduate Center 3212.

## COVID

All students, faculty, and staff must comply with and stay current on all [university safety and health guidance](https://www.cuny.edu/coronavirus). Accommodations will be made based on university guidelines.

## Other Policies

## Discussion and Communication Guidelines

The following are my expectations for how we should communicate as a class. Above all, please remember to be respectful and thoughtful.

- **Writing style**: This course's common theme is applying theoretical principles to problems in programming languages. As with all theoretical foundations, your solutions must be precise and detailed: you must work out all necessary details to solve the problem using the approaches discussed in class. You must write your answers to convince the reader that you understand all these details. Be careful, precise, and thorough.
- **Tone and civility**: maintain a supportive learning community where everyone feels safe and where people can disagree amicably and professionally. We will respect each other and practice courtesy at all times. Disrespectful language, including, but not limited to, sexist, racist, homophobic, or anti-ethnic slurs or bigotry, will not be tolerated. I am committed to making the classroom a comfortable space for all of us, and I ask that we all work toward this goal in all of the course's online areas.
- **Citing your sources**: When we have academic discussions, please cite your sources to back up what you say. List the title and page numbers for the textbook or other course materials. For online sources, include a link.
- **Backing up your work**: Consider composing your academic posts in a word processor, where you can save your work and then copying into Bb.

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person (once a week) and via Zoom (once weekly). See Bb for details. Attending office hours is optional, and no appointment is necessary. Please arrange an alternative meeting time if you cannot make it during the scheduled office hours. Appointments during office hours are not allowed.

## Email

Please post all class-related discussions on Bb. Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email address for FERPA reasons. Also, please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Discussion Board

We will use the Bb discussion board for questions and discussions. Participation in Bb discussions is optional.

## Bulletin Board

You should check CUNY [Blackboard](http://bbhosted.cuny.edu) (Bb) regularly since the instructor will post all class material there. You are responsible for any email the instructors might send there. Please ensure you have configured Bb to use your *CUNY email address*.

## Student Expectations

For this course, you must:

- Participate in class discussions and activities.
- Do the homework assignments.
- Read the assigned papers and submit one-page critiques before class.
- Prepare and deliver presentations on selected topics.
- Complete a term project.

## Assessment

Category | Mode | Percentage
-------- | ---- | ----------
Assignments | Individual | 15%
Class participation and discussion | Individual | 10%
Paper Critiques | Individual | 15%
Paper Presentation | Individual | 20%
Research Project | Individual or Team | 40%

[^1]: In this course, when we mention "performance," we will refer to *run-time* performance. In AI, the term "performance" is often associated with how well an ML model works in terms of its ability to make predictions and perform classifications. This course will refer to this as model *accuracy* instead of performance.

## Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments.
- Assignments result from **individual effort** unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

## Academic Violations

The classroom environment employed will be that of a professional one. While students may discuss course materials and assignments with others, any submitted work in this course must result from *individual* effort *only*. Students are *strongly* advised to read the following resources regarding academic integrity:

- [Student Handbook](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/Publications/Student_Handbook_web.pdf)
- [Avoiding and Detecting Plagiarism](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/Publications/AvoidingPlagiarism.pdf)

### Written Assignments

Your written assignments should be your original work. General high-level discussion of assignments with other students in the class is allowed, but all actual work should be your own. Do not provide your solutions to other students.

### Projects

Projects should be done independently, within your group, or alone. General high-level discussion of projects with other students in the class is allowed.
