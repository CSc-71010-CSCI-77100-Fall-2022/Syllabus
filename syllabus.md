## Course Description

The purpose of this research course is to expose students to seminal topics and recent trends in the field of Programming Languages and Software Engineering with a focus on program analysis and software maintenance and evolution. The theme topic of the course varies with each offering. For Fall 2022, the theme of the course will be programming language concepts and software engineering for Machine Learning (ML), including Deep Learning (DL), systems. Such systems have become pervasive in society recently, and their programming and engineering comes with a set of unique challenges. Our focus in this course will be to improve nonfunctional aspects of these systems. Nonfunctional aspects of software may include security, runtime performance,[^1] and modularity. DL systems, in particular, work with a lot of data; thus, performance---especially in the training stage---is of the utmost importance. However, programming and engineering such systems is difficult, especially for data scientists, who may not be classically-trained Software Engineers. As such, having both programmability and performance of DL systems is our goal. Doing so would avert potential errors, misclassifications, faulty predictions, and performance bottlenecks, which otherwise costs time, energy, and money.

We will be investigating:

1. Innovative future automated development techniques (program analysis, software engineering, and human-computer interaction) of ML/DL software systems, and
1. The research technical thrusts that enable new ways to program and engineer ML/DL systems.

Our exploration will consist of in-class discussions of the literature and team projects that encourage risk taking. The course will offer an opportunity for students to pursue research-oriented or novel industrial term projects in small teams (2-4 students). Students may pursue any project of their choosing that explores the intersection of software maintenance and evolution, mobile and IoT systems.

The course will offer an opportunity for students to pursue research-oriented or novel industrial term projects either individually or in small teams (2-4 students). Students may choose projects from a list of project ideas provided by the instructor. Alternatively, students may a pitch a project to the instructor and/or class. Projects should involve programming languages and software engineering. Projects exploring the intersection of programming languages, software engineering, software maintenance and evolution, and ML/DL systems are welcome and encouraged.

To complement the innovative facets of the course, we will couple the investigations with a firm theoretical foundation in programming languages, program analysis and transformation, integrated development environment engineering, and software maintenance and evolution. Other topics may include control-flow analysis, dataflow analysis, SSA form, type analysis, pointer/alias analysis, side-effect analysis, and program slicing. Imperative and Object-Oriented programming paradigms---and their application in dynamic languages (like Python)---will be thoroughly considered.

The course materials will include an introduction to basic foundations and current advances in the area of, for example, static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) program analysis, as well as some related program transformations. Static program analyses are traditionally used in compilers and interpreters for performance optimizations, as well as in software engineering tools for software understanding, evolution, debugging, and testing. The material will be useful for students working in compilers, systems, software engineering, and programming languages, or incorporating such areas into their ongoing research in other areas (interdisciplinary research).

## Course Objectives

- Expand students' knowledge more broadly about Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Software Maintenance and Evolution research & practice, and become familiar with the state-of-the-art research under the theme of ML/DL System programming and engineering.
- Develop critical thinking abilities by being able to assess the quality of published research and pose new research questions.
- Practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others.
- Engage in active learning activities in class, such as research discussions.
- Practice developing a research or novel-industrial project through all its stages: formulating a research problem, posing research questions, gathering related work, designing a solution, evaluating the solution empirically, writing a research paper.
- Have fun learning.

## Course Organization

The course will have the following parts:

### Lectures by the Instructor

I will present an overview of some basic programming languages and software engineering concepts, including **static analyses** and the related **program transformations**. The goal of these lectures is to establish some background for the project. No previous knowledge of program analysis is expected. I will start from scratch and will cover both a number of specific analyses/transformations as well as the corresponding theoretical foundations.

### Presentations by Students

Students will prepare and deliver presentations of selected topics. By doing so, students will practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others.

### Homework

- There will be one or more homework assignments with small problems related to the material presented in the lectures. Each will be assigned in Blackboard along with submission instructions. The exact instructions will follow.
- Assignments should be done independently. General, high-level discussion of assignments with other students in the class is allowed, but all actual work should be your own. Written assignments that show excessive similarities will be taken as evidence of cheating and dealt with accordingly. See more details below under "Academic integrity."
- Assignments should be turned in by the beginning of the lecture on the due day. You can submit up to 24 hours after the deadline; if you do so, your score will be reduced by 10%. If you submit more than 24 hours after the deadline, the submission will not be accepted.

### Project

The project may be implemented individual or with small teams (2-4 students). Projects should be specific to each student/student team and tailored to her/his ongoing and future research.

## Textbooks and Materials

Selected research papers will be available online.

## Prerequisites

You should have at least basic knowledge of an imperative, Object-Oriented programming language, such as Java, C++, or Python. Furthermore, you should have some experience in developing medium to large software systems to properly appreciate the engineering challenges involved. Speak with me if you are not sure whether you have the necessary background.

## Attendance

This is an interactive course. Attendance is expected for each and every class meeting. Excused absences include University-related travel (e.g., to attend an academic conference), job interviews, and illness; but please notify me beforehand or as soon as possible.

## Mode of Delivery

This course is in-person in Graduate Center 3212.

## COVID

All students, faculty, and staff are required to comply with and stay up to date on all [university safety and health guidance](https://www.cuny.edu/coronavirus). Accommodations will be made based on university guidelines.

## Other Policies

## Discussion and Communication Guidelines

The following are my expectations for how we should communicate as a class. Above all, please remember to be respectful and thoughtful.

- **Writing style**: a common theme of this course is the application of theoretical principles to problems in programming languages. As with all theoretical foundations, your solutions must be precise and detailed: you must work out all details that are necessary to solve the problem using the approaches discussed in class. You must write your solutions in a way that convinces the reader that you understand all these details. Be careful, precise, and thorough.
- **Tone and civility**: maintain a supportive learning community where everyone feels safe and where people can disagree amicably and professionally. I am committed to making the classroom a comfortable space for all of us, and I ask that we all work toward this goal in all of the course's online spaces. We will respect each other and practice civility at all times. Disrespectful language including, but not limited to, sexist, racist, homophobic, or anti-ethnic slurs, or bigotry will not be tolerated.
- **Citing your sources**: When we have academic discussions, please cite your sources to back up what you say. For the textbook or other course materials, list at least the title and page numbers. For online sources, include a link.
- **Backing up your work**: Consider composing your academic posts in a word processor, where you can save your work, and then copying into Bb.

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in-person (once a week) and via Zoom (once a week). See Bb for details. Attending office hours is optional, and no appointment is necessary to attend. If you cannot make it during the scheduled office hours, please arrange an alternative meeting time. Appointments during office hours are not allowed.

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email address for FERPA reasons. Please post all class-related discussion on Bb. Also, please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Discussion Board

We will use the Bb discussion board for questions and discussions. Participation in Bb discussions is optional.

## Bulletin Board

You should check CUNY [Blackboard](http://bbhosted.cuny.edu) (Bb) regularly, since all class material will be posted there. Please make sure you have configured Bb to use your *CUNY email address*. You are responsible for any email the instructors might send there.

## Student Expectations

For this course, you must:

- Participate in class discussion and activities.
- Do the homework assignments.
- Read the assigned papers and submit one-page critiques before class.
- Prepare and deliver presentations of selected topics.
- Complete a term project.

## Assessment

Category | Mode | Percentage
-------- | ---- | ----------
Assignments | Individual | 15%
Class participation and discussion | Individual | 10%
Paper Critiques | Individual | 15%
Paper Presentation | Individual | 20%
Research Project | Individual or Team | 40%

[^1]: In this course, when we mention "performance," we will be referring to *runtime* performance. In AI, the term "performance" is often times associated with how well an ML model works in terms of its ability to make predictions and perform classifications. In this course, we will refer to this as model *accuracy* instead of performance.

## Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments.
- Assignments are the result of **individual effort** unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

## Academic Violations

The classroom environment employed will be that of a professional one. While students may discuss course materials and assignments with others, any submitted work in this course must be the result of *individual* effort *only*. Students are *strongly* advised to read the following resources regarding academic integrity:

- [Student Handbook](http://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/Publications/Student_Handbook_web.pdf)
- [Avoiding and Detecting Plagiarism](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/CUNY_GC/media/CUNY-Graduate-Center/PDF/Publications/AvoidingPlagiarism.pdf)

### Written Assignments

Your written assignments should be your own original work. General high-level discussion of assignments with other students in the class is allowed, but all actual work should be your own. Do not provide your own solutions to other students.

### Projects
