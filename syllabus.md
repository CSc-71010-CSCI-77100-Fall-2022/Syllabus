## Course Description

The purpose of this research course is to expose students to seminal topics and recent trends in the field of Programming Languages and Software Engineering with a focus on program analysis and software maintenance and evolution. The theme topic of the course varies with each offering. For Fall 2022, the theme of the course will be programming language concepts and software engineering for Machine Learning (ML), including Deep Learning (DL), systems. Such systems have become pervasive in society recently, and their programming and engineering comes with a set of unique challenges. Our focus in this course will be to improve nonfunctional aspects of these systems. Nonfunctional aspects of software may include security, runtime performance,[^1] and modularity. DL systems, in particular, work with a lot of data; thus, performance---especially in the training stage---is of the utmost importance. However, programming and engineering such systems is difficult, especially for data scientists, who may not be classically-trained Software Engineers. As such, having both programmability and performance of DL systems is our goal. Doing so would avert potential errors, misclassifications, faulty predictions, and performance bottlenecks, which otherwise costs time, energy, and money.

We will be investigating:

1. Innovative future automated development techniques (program analysis, software engineering, and human-computer interaction) of ML/DL software systems, and
1. The research technical thrusts that enable new ways to program and engineer ML/DL systems.

Our exploration will consist of in-class discussions of the literature and team projects that encourage risk taking. To complement the innovative facets of the course, we will couple the investigations with a firm theoretical foundation in programming languages, program analysis and transformation, integrated development environment engineering, and software maintenance and evolution. Other topics may include control-flow analysis, dataflow analysis, SSA form, type analysis, pointer/alias analysis, side-effect analysis, and program slicing. Imperative and Object-Oriented programming paradigms---and their application in dynamic languages (like Python)---will be thoroughly considered.

The course materials will include an introduction to basic foundations and current advances in the area of, for example, static (compile-time) and dynamic (run-time) program analysis, as well as some related program transformations. Static program analyses are traditionally used in compilers and interpreters for performance optimizations, as well as in software engineering tools for software understanding, evolution, debugging, and testing. The material will be useful for students working in compilers, systems, software engineering, and programming languages, or incorporating such areas into their ongoing research in other areas (interdisciplinary research).

## Course Objectives

- Expand students' knowledge more broadly about Programming Languages, Software Engineering, and Software Maintenance and Evolution research & practice, and become familiar with the state-of-the-art research under the theme of ML/DL System programming and engineering.
- Develop critical thinking abilities by being able to assess the quality of published research and pose new research questions.
- Practice giving scientific presentations and teaching others.
- Engage in active learning activities in class, such as research discussions.
- Practice developing a research or novel-industrial project through all its stages: formulating a research problem, posing research questions, gathering related work, designing a solution, evaluating the solution empirically, writing a research paper.
- Have fun learning.

## Textbooks and Materials

Selected research papers will be available online.

## Prerequisites

You should have at least basic knowledge of an imperative, Object-Oriented programming language, such as Java, C++, or Python. Furthermore, you should have some experience in developing medium to large software systems to properly appreciate the engineering challenges involved. Speak with me if you are not sure whether you have the necessary background.

## Attendance

This is an interactive course. Attendance is expected for each and every class meeting. Excused absences include University-related travel (e.g., to attend an academic conference), job interviews, and illness; but please notify me beforehand or as soon as possible.

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY email address for FERPA reasons. Please post all class-related discussion on Bb. Also, please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the CUNY Blackboard.

## Bulletin Board

You should check CUNY [Blackboard](http://bbhosted.cuny.edu) (Bb) regularly, since all class material will be posted there. Please make sure you have configured Bb to use your *CUNY email address*. You are responsible for any email the instructors might send there.

## Student Expectations

For this course, you must:

- Participate in class discussion and activities.
- Do the homework assignments.
- Read the assigned papers and submit one-page critiques before class.
- Prepare and deliver presentations of selected topics.
- Complete a term project.

[^1]: In this course, when we mention "performance," we will be referring to *runtime* performance. In AI, the term "performance" is often times associated with how well an ML model works in terms of its ability to make predictions and perform classifications. In this course, we will refer to this as model *accuracy* instead of performance.
